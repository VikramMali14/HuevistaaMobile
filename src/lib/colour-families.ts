 * Parent colour families for the catalogue filter.

 * The filter row was raw brand data, every company's own taxonomy flattened into
 * one list of peers: "Blues", "Blue-greens", "Blue Greens & Greens", "Neutrals",
 * "Classic Neutrals", "Neutrals: Browns & Greys", "Off Whites", "Whispering
 * Whites" and "Whites" all sitting side by side. That is not a taxonomy anyone
 * can filter with — it is three companies' marketing vocabularies in a row, and
 * it made the row long enough to need a sideways scroller.
 *
 * These nine parents are the ones a person actually shops by. The brand's own
 * name is never thrown away: it is shown underneath as a sub-filter, so a
 * retailer who knows "Whispering Whites" can still get exactly that.
