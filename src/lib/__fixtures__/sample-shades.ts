/**
 * The bundled SAMPLE catalogue — the last-resort fallback when the live one can't be
 * reached, and the demo-mode data set.
 *
 * Every entry here is invented. It used to be invented and labelled "Asian Paints",
 * with codes in that company's format ("AP-1428"), names it does not use, and finish
 * names lifted from its real product lines. Nothing in the list matched anything a
 * customer could buy, so a shop reading a code off this screen would have ordered a
 * shade that does not exist — and a real company's range was being described,
 * publicly and wrongly, by us.
 *
 * So the sample says what it is. The company is "Sample palette", the codes carry an
 * HV- prefix that belongs to no paint manufacturer, and the finishes are the generic
 * ones every company shares. Real shades — real codes, real names, real companies —
 * come from the live catalogue, loaded from those companies' own published data.
 *
 * If you add to this list, keep it that way: no real company name, and no code that
 * could be mistaken for one.
